Zeo.NET is a C# port of the Python Zeo raw data library.

Hardware:
In order to use this library please consult the Zeo documentation
for building an interface cable and installing the raw data version
of the firmware.

http://zeorawdata.sourceforge.net/api.html

Usage:

The ZeoMonitor console application is an example of an extremely simple
client app.  Using the library is simply a matter of creating an instance
of the BaseLink class that is bound to the correct COM port and binding
the data event to an instance of the Parser class.
